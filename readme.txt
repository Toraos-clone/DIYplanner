A small database project to help me map out the tools and supplies needed for DIY projects. The real reason was to help me spend more time learning SQLite.
I set it up to be able to edit the database and to save to a CSV file. I had planned on adding an API connection option to get pricing, but that ended up being 
more difficult once I thought about having to handle names. Paint is very generic. That might be future functionality to consider especially since I saw it's possible to
have the user select the item from a list on like HomeDepot.com. Other changes I'd like to make someday is adding in instructions and maybe pictures of the things afterward.
